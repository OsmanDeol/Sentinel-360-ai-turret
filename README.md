## 📂 Repository Structure

This project is split into 3 main components. Each has its own dedicated README for clarity and in-depth documentation:

- [`frontend/`](./frontend) — Web Dashboard built with Next.js → [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md)
- [`backend/`](./backend) — PC-side YOLO + Flask system → [Backend README](./backend/README.md)
- [`pi/`](./pi) — Raspberry Pi code for controlling servos → [Pi README](./pi/README.md)


### 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Auto Tracking Mode**: Face recognition and automatic pan-tilt targeting using YOLOv8.
- 🕹️ **Manual Mode**: Real-time joystick control from a futuristic web dashboard.
- 🔒 **Surveillance Mode**: Sends an email alert and records footage when a person is detected.
- 🌐 **Interactive Dashboard** (built with Next.js): Switch modes, view live feed, and monitor status.
- 💡 **Hardware Integration**: Built using Raspberry Pi, camera, servos, joystick.
- 📷 **Video Feed & Recording**: Live feed with auto-lock, and recording during intrusions.
